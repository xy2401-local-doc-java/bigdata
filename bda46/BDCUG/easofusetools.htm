<div>
<p>Oracle Big Data Connectors are a powerful toolset for data interchange between Hadoop and Oracle Database. Learning how to set up the environment for these tools and use them to full potential is worthwhile, but there are ways to get started and be productive without fully completing that learning curve. Oracle is developing a set of ease-of-use tools for this purpose.</p>
<p>Oracle Shell for Hadoop Loaders is the first ease-of-use tool for Oracle Big Data Connectors.</p>

<div>
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead2">What is Oracle Shell for Hadoop Loaders?</p>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->
<p>Oracle Shell for Hadoop Loaders (OHSH) is a helper shell that provides a simple to use command line interface to Oracle Loader for Hadoop, Oracle SQL Connector for HDFS, and Copy to Hadoop.&nbsp;It has basic shell features such as command line recall, history, inheriting environment variables from the parent process,&nbsp;setting new or existing environment variables, and performing environmental substitution in the command line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The core functionality of Oracle Shell for Hadoop Loaders includes the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Defining named external resources with which Oracle Shell for Hadoop Loaders interacts to perform loading tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting default values for load operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running load commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delegating simple pre and post load tasks to the Operating System, HDFS, Hive and Oracle.&nbsp;These tasks include viewing the data to be loaded, and viewing the data in the target table after loading.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead2">Getting Started with Oracle Shell for Hadoop Loaders</p>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->
<p>To set up Oracle Shell for Hadoop Loaders, follow the instructions in the <span class="italic">Oracle Big Data SQL Installation Guide</span>.</p>
<p>The examples directory in the OHSH kit contains many examples that define resources and load data using Oracle Shell for Hadoop Loaders.&nbsp;See <code>&lt;OHSH_KIT&gt;/examples/README.txt</code> for a description of the examples and instructions for running them.</p>
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead2">Getting Help</p>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->
<p>The OHSH shell provides online help for all commands.</p>
<p>To get a list of all possible OHSH commands:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">
ohsh&gt;% help
</pre>
<p>To get help on a specific command, enter <code>help</code>, followed by the command:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<pre dir="ltr">
ohsh&gt;% help show
</pre>
<p>The table below describes the help categories available.</p>
